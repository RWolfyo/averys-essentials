Hi, this is Avery's Essentials, a modpack I've made that meets all of my personal necessities because no other modpack could.
It includes performance mods, Optifine replacement mods and technical mods.

It also includes No Chat Reports which protects you from global bans where possible.


Warning
------------------
**_Multiple mods in this modpack could be considered cheating on certain servers. Please always check the server's rules and if
necessary ask the server moderators as use of this modpack could be reason for them to punish/ban you!_**

I am an uni student, **I can not provide tech support, neither can I promise you quick updates.**

Misc
------------------

This pack is originally based off Fabulously Optimized. It still takes a lot of inspiration and pulls a lot of its mods
directly from it. Support them [**here**](https://www.modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized "Fabulously Optimized").

- **Can I build off of this pack?**
  Yes you can, do as you please.
- **What license is this?**
  It's MIT licensed.
